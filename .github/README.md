# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles and Bash scripts.

The following instructions ate intended for:

1. Me, so I can easily install everything on a new machine.
2. People who want to use this repository as a template for their own dotfiles.

## 📌 Prerequisites

Linux distro, [WSL][wsl] or [Git for Windows][git-win] with:

- [GNU Bash][bash] >= 4.4
- [GNU Coreutils][coreutils] >= 8.26
- [Git][git] >= 2.17

Compatibility with BSD, OS X or others is not guaranteed.

## 📦 Installation

> 🚨 Be careful when running any of the commands mentioned bellow.
> You can easily lose your own configuration or data if you don't
> know what you are doing.

Clone bare repository to `~/.dotfiles.git` directory.

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:jpikl/dotfiles.git     ~/.dotfiles.git # SSH
git clone --bare https://github.com/jpikl/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles.git # HTTPS
```

Create an alias for Git to operate under the cloned repository.

```bash
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles.git --work-tree=$HOME'
```

Checkout `master` branch to initialize dotfiles in home directory.

```bash
dotfiles checkout
dotfiles checkout -f # To overwrite possible conflicts.
```

Logout and login to reload Bash environment.

> ℹ️ Any changes in Bash environment can be now easily reloaded
> using `bashreload` alias.

### Post-installation

Set-up your local [environment](#login-shell) and [aliases](#interactive-shell).

Add your local [Git](#-git) or [SSH](#-ssh) configuration.

Install recommended [tools](#-tools).

Personalize your [terminal](#%EF%B8%8F-terminal).

Use `homefiles` command to initialize home directory structure.

```bash
homefiles -h # Print usage
```

## 🚧 Repository

Git operations for this repository have to be executed using `dotfiles` command.

```bash
dotfiles status # Instead of 'git status'
```

Everything in the home directory is ignored by default and
needs to be  forcibly added using `-f, --force` option.

```bash
dotfiles add -f ~/.xyz
dotfiles commit -m "Add xyz dotfile"
dotfiles push
```

There is also more low-level `dotenv` command which provides `GIT_DIR`
and `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables:

```bash
dotenv git status # Same as 'dotfiles status'
dotenv code       # Run Visual Studio Code with set-up environment
```

## 🗃️ Bash

Bash scripts of this repository are managed using the `bashfiles` command.


```bash
bashfiles -h # Print usage
```

The command only operates on scripts that were added to this repository.

```bash
bashfiles # List files by default
```

These files can be validated using [shellcheck][shellcheck].

```bash
bashfiles check # Run shellcheck
```

You can also print list of [available commands](commands.md).

```bash
bashfiles describe # In plaintext
bashfiles markdown # In markdown
```

### Login shell

Directory `~/.profile.d/` contains several scripts which are loaded when
starting Bash as a login shell.

All of these scripts follow `<order>-<target>.sh` naming convention.

- `order` - Double digit number. Scripts with lower value are loaded first.
- `target` - What the script relates to. For example, a name of an application.

See comment inside [~/.profile](../.profile) for more detailed description.

Custom local configuration belongs to `10-local.sh`.
Use `10-local.sh.template` as a template.

### Interactive shell

Directory `~/.bashrc.d/` contains several scripts which are loaded when
starting Bash in interactive mode.

All of these scripts follow the same naming convention as `~/.profile.d/`.
See comment inside [~/.bashrc](../.bashrc) for more detailed description.

Custom local configuration belongs to `70-local.sh`.
Use `70-local.sh.template` as a template.

## 🔶 Git

Git configuration is located in the `~/.config/git` directory.

- `config` - Main configuration and [aliases](commands.md#git-aliases).
- `config.local` - Custom local configuration included by `config`.
- `config.local.template` - Template for creating `config.local` .
- `config.scope.template` - Template for creating a scoped local configuration.
- `config.windows` - Additional Git tweaks for Windows.

## 🔑 SSH

SSH configuration is located in the `~/.ssh` directory.

- `config` - Main configuration.
- `config.local` - Custom local configuration included by `config`.
- `config.local.template` - Template for creating `config.local`.

Use `sshgen` command to generate SSH keys. They will be automatically
used by `~/.ssh/config` when accessing related hostname.

The `~/.profile.d/60-ssh-agent.sh` script automatically starts `ssh-agent`
process after login. Internally, it uses `sshctl` command to control
the `ssh-agent`. As an user, do not call `sshctl` directly but use one
of the [following aliases](commands.md#60-sshsh).

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

See also Git for Windows [Known issues][git-win-issues].

### Git for Windows Bash rewrites `/` to `C:/Program Files/Git`

Workarounds:

1. Run command with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` or export this environment variable temporarily.
2. Use double slash `//` instead of `/`

### Poor Git performance on Windows

1. Assuming `C:\Program Files\Git` is your Git installation directory,
   add these paths **at the beginning** of `Path` environment variable:

   ```text
   C:\Program Files\Git\bin
   C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
   C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin
   ```

2. Add `HOME` environment variable with value `%USERPROFILE%`.
3. See also [Diagnosing performance issues][git-win-perf] on Git for Windows Wiki.

### Commands not working in ConEmu

Some commands does not work well with ConEmu/Bash on Windows.

- [fzf][fzf] - Fails with [character set not supported][fzf-charset-issue].
- [mvn][mvn] - Does not output colors.

Workarounds using [winpty][winpty]:

1. Wrap command execution using `winpty`.

   ```bash
   winpty fzf
   winpty any-other-command
   ```

   This unfortunately does not work for `mvn`, executed as `winpty mvn.cmd`.
   Also any alias or command that internally uses `fzf` won't work.

2. Wrap `bash` execution using `winpty`.

   ```bash
   winpty bash -li
   ```

   This unfortunately breaks some other commands like `bat` which
   stops printing colors.
